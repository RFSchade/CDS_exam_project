# Plotting a small stock-taking survey of data-sharing at Aarhus University

This is an exam project for the course "Introduction to Cultural Data Science" at Aarhus University, Denmark. 

## Project description

The goal of this project is to visualize a potential gap between opinions and actions concerning open data at Aarhus University.
