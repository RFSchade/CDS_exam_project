Data is often the main result of research and should thus be shared.",often,no,"I think it is important to share data only after validating they are good quality, useful and can be interpreted.

Also, under current incentives sharing before publication is potentially risky career-wise (although it shouldn't be)",never,often,"GitHub, Zenodo, Supplementary materials (often more of those at once)",not relevant for me,not relevant for me,often,Pretty good - in bioinformatics most of the data is shared in reasonably well documented and maintained repositories.

28,male,academic,3,Anthropology,yes,"General discussions on data, methods, and analysis",important,"Not generally, no.",no,"My field works primarily in so-called 'ethnographic data,' understood here as data created via ethnographic fieldwork, participant observation, interviews, and so forth. This material is, for better or worse, tied directly to the fieldwork in question and owes its existence to the specific relations the fieldwork has with her or his 'informants' or interlocutors in the field. These are often, or become over time, personal relations that go beyond merely an official researcher-to-research subject relation. In a sense, the 'data' that we have collectively produced in the context of fieldwork is 'ours', together and is only made ethnographically relevant insofar as it is produced, and situated, in a network of other such relations (involving the researcher and all other relevant informants, who often have complex relationships among them as well). This complicates the open sharing of data in several ways. Among them is the fact that some of data exists as fieldnotes, which is produced according to the fieldworkers personal preferences and which can potentially contain information that could not or should not count as data. Secondly, data in the fieldwork tradition is a collective production that extends beyond the recorded notes or transcribed interviews - they make sense to the fieldwork and the people involved in ways that might not make sense to others. Again, for better or for worse. These are just a few reasons as to why I am not sure that sharing data is necessarily important. The ethnographer is always accountable to the people she or he works with but is simulatenously responsible for upholding GDPR regulations - this involved as mix of hiding identities while still letting the informants find themselves adequately 'represented' in the published material. This requires a great deal of finesse in how data is used analytically in publications, and which would be rendered useless if data was to be shared in a form usable to others, at least if not done carefully. Finally, I am not certain that anyone would have actual use for 'raw' data produced ethnographically, it does not lend itself well to replication... (I won't even start here) and using it out of context would violate both the implicit and explicit negotiations of what can be communicated and how that the ethnographer continuously engages in with the people in the field.    This is not to say that open data in anthropology and ethnography is impossible or should be resisted (anthropologists working in interdisciplinary teams already engage in such processes of sharing, albeit internally). But it serves as partial reasons for why I think it less important and for why I have not done it myself.",never,no,I guess I covered this in the last answer as well.,never,never,NA,NA,no,sometimes,"Tricky question. I have used other people's data in the sense of incorporating their analysis, arguments, and 'results' in my own work. But this is standard academic practice that does not necessarily constitute (or require) the kinds of open data practices you have been referring to earlier."
22,female,student,2,Cognitive Science,yes,"Study, Cognitive Science",very important,"Maybe it would be good to add that the data is also in a ""state"" that it can be used by anyone, for example that it has meta-data, so that it is understandable to others",yes,"""stand on the shoulders of giants"", you can build up on each others research, you can see how others collected data, use their data, and research is paid for through taxes, so the results should be available to everyone.",never,yes,I think the data should be available at any time of the process,never,always,GitHub,yes,not relevant for me,often,"Often difficult, because of a lack of metadata"

24,female,student,3,anthropology,yes,cultural data science subject,important,I agree with the definition above,no,"In anthropology, we work with interviews and participant observation.

The veracity of findings can also be checked.",always,no,"People invest a lot of time and work in data collection and they should be rewarded. Under the current systems, the main way we reward work is with credit for publications.

In a slightly Popper-esque sense, only those conclusions which withstand sustained criticism should be taken as valid. Any new method, therefore, of checking and validating findings, will naturally lead to increased credibility.    Making this a reality in the current cutthroat academic environment (and with respect to regulations such as GDPR) is another matter entirely. But where reasonably possible, data should be shared.    (Addendum to my answer to the question below: I've made exactly 0 publications in the last 24 months, so the answer *has to be* never).",never,yes,"I think this is perhaps slightly less important, but cultivating this sort of culture could probably be beneficial for the scientific community at large.
